# GifTastic

This is a dynamic webpage which populates with gifs from classic television shows. 

## Description

Buttons labeled with classic television shows from the 60's, 70's and 80's are at the top of the page. Clicking on one of these buttons produces ten gifs with a rating of PG-13 or lower. Clicking on another button, does the same for that TV show, and the new gifs appear above the old gifs. The user can even type in their own television show into the form to the right of the page, submit it, and a new button for that show appears at the top of the page under the existing buttons. Clicking on the new button will produce ten new gifs above the others. As many new buttons can be added as the user desires.
